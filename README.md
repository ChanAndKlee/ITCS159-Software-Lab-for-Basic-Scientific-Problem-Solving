# ITCS159-Software-Lab-for-Basic-Scientific-Problem-Solving
#### This is a compilation of all projects that I have done within the software lab class.

Currently, the topics will be covered Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sklearn, NLTK, etc.

#### Ps. files might be unorganized somehow since different week requires different naming files and some are used for practicing, however all contents were gathered.
